# Modular_Inverse

Connects the numbers that are modular inverses of each other in mod N where N is the number in the left corner (controlled by the bottom slider). The top right number is normally 1 to calculate modular inverse, but in general if it is denoted by M, the app maps A and B where [A][B]= M (mod N).

to run, execute the file located at ./out/artifacts/Modular_Inverse_jar/Modular_Inverse.jar
